# Seven-Day-Average
This is a real life problem proposed by CS50x. It is an algorithm to track COVID cases in USA states, it returns a 7-day average number of cases and compares this weekâ€™s average to the previous week, returning the percentual of increase or decrease. For this we're using a New York Times repository of live, cumulative COVID data.
